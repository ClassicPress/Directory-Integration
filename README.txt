Enables a ClassicPress Plugin Screen to browse, install, activate, deactivate, update, delete and paginate ClassicPress Plugins.

== Description ==

Install and activate like any other plugin.

Navigate to Dashboard > Plugins > CP Plugins and start Installing Plugins. 
You can install, activate, deactivate, update, delete, and also search Plugins from within the same screen.
The Directory results are cached locally for fast performance, and you can refresh the local cache on the click of a button.

It has a pagination and a total plugins display to navigate (15 plugins a time) through the assets.
A "more info" will display all information known to ClassicPress about the plugin and developer.

The plugin requires wp_remote_get and file_put_contents to work properly on the server.
The plugin does not take any responsibility for Plugins downloaded from the ClassicPress Directory.
